The clinic has successfully performed 7,000 successful nose corrections and more than 20,000 plastic surgeries in total. In addition, the clients of the medical center are numerous celebrities, artists, and politicians. Impeccable reputation and compliance with world medical standards allowed the hospital to gain international and аmerican recognition (ISAPS, АSAPS, TPCD). In addition, the medical center received JCI quality certification. All treatment is aimed at maintaining harmony and a natural appearance. The focus is on minimally invasive techniques that do not leave visible scars and reduce the duration of rehabilitation. Even ear correction with incisions and removal of excess tissue is performed so that all faults are hidden behind the ear in natural skin folds. In addition, the hospital serves transconjunctival aesthetics of the eyelids so that the scars are not on the outside. The endoscopic technique is available even for facial skin cushions through 3 small openings.  Numerous closed methods, including rhinoplasty, have advantages over classic ones due to the lack of trauma and a more straightforward patient recovery process. Another feature of the medical center is a comprehensive approach to appearance problems. For example, post-bariatric surgery corrects sagging skin due to a rapid decrease in attention in all areas by lifting the body and breasts and removing gynecomastia in men.  Vacuum, PAL (Power Assisted Liposuction), ultrasound, and WAL (using water injection) liposuction are used for areas with constant fat accumulation that do not lose weight on their own. The doctor selects the most appropriate method of treatment during a detailed examination. If there is a need for simultaneous skin tightening and fat removal, RFAL (radiofrequency liposuction) is the method of choice. In addition to body aesthetics, FUE, DHI, and the modernized Saphire FUE technique, hair transplantation is also a popular service at the clinic and has a high success rate. Soyep Aesthetics Clinic Istanbul offers plastic surgery on all body areas, including blepharoplasty, rhinoplasty, face and body skin lifting, ear correction, liposuction and lipolytic injections, breast reconstruction, gynecomastia treatment, genital aesthetic surgery, and hair transplantation.

According to the HLA compatibility system, careful donor selection occurs in the network's ISO-certified laboratory. The patient receives a detailed discussion of all stages of treatment and surgery from the doctor in an individual case, significantly contributing to adherence to treatment and better maintenance of a healthy lifestyle.  Kidney transplantation occurs without contact with the intestines and outside the abdominal cavity, contributing to the rapid restoration of the patient's nutrition.  On the 5-8th day of stay, the patient can be discharged with a fully functioning kidney. Modern post-transplantation treatment helps maintain the foreign organ and reduces the risk of rejection. In addition, the heart surgeons of the medical center also achieved a breakthrough in the high survival rate of patients after surgery. Transcatheter treatment of the mitral valve ensures the absence of large chest incisions and artificial cardiac arrest during surgery. The TAVI method allows the endovascular method to eliminate damage to the aortic valve.  Another method of choice for aortic valve treatment is the OZAKI procedure, replacing the valve with a new one made from the patient's membrane.  This approach reduces the risk of thrombosis and does not require medical blood thinning. DSA digital angiography allows the diagnosis of vascular diseases thanks to visualizing the whole body. Acibadem International Hospital Istanbul provides a wide range of services with high-quality service. The clinic includes cardiac surgery, gynecology and obstetrics departments, organ transplantation, IVF, neurosurgery, general surgery and oncology.

High-tech branches and services are a substantial advantage of Acibadem Maslak Сlinic in Istanbul. The medical center is famous for its robotic surgical treatment methods.  The Navio Knee robot treats traumatic and primary knee osteoarthritis.  Thanks to the 3D image, the robot analyzes the patient's joint surface features and makes an operation plan. This approach reduces the risks of the need for repeated surgery, contributes to an individual strategy for each patient, and reduces erroneous blade movements.  DaVinci robot allows doctors to treat the most challenging cases without unnecessary trauma.  Microsurgical incisions, high precision thanks to 3D imaging, and the absence of hand tremors reduce the risks of damaging healthy tissue. The DaVinci robot is often used for oncological diseases, particularly prostate and kidney cancer. It can be operated on for mitral valve correction, coronary bypass surgery, thyroid gland removal, and bariatric surgery.  Otolaryngologists use the TORS (transoral robotic surgery) to remove benign or malignant tumors of the oral cavity, larynx, tongue, and tonsils.  3 Tesla intraoperative MRI allows fast, high-precision imaging data during surgery for better control and the ability to adjust the course of the operation for a more gentle approach. High efficiency in treating oncological diseases is also possible through high-precision tumor excision and Trilogy/TrueBeam radiological methods. Technologies are innovative and irreplaceable because they combine all radiation therapy methods (IMRT, IGRT, Gated RT, RapidArc, SRS, SBRT). 3D Prostate Biopsy Imaging and Navigation System, 4D Breast Ultrasound, Cervical Light Screening Method, and EBUS Airway detect cancer early and are ideal for cancer screening. In addition to essential services, ophthalmologists offer highly effective treatment of disorders with excimer lasers, as well as treatment of cataracts with FEMTOlaser without the use of a scalpel.

The motto of Acibadem Taksim Clinic Istanbul is an individual and comprehensive approach to each case of illness. Thanks to this, orthopedists use Conformis and X-PSI for endoprosthetics, which take into account the features of the surface of the affected joints. In addition, the clinic focuses on the high-quality diagnosis of liver diseases by non-invasive methods, such as Fibroscan. The device uses an extensive ultrasound assessment of the entire liver structure instead of a point-by-point examination of tissue from a liver biopsy. Also, hepatologists use the latest treatment methods for liver cirrhosis, alcohol toxicity, and infection hepatitis, with particular attention to complications.  Thanks to the work of DaVinci, surgeons gently treat tumor lesions of the liver and internal organs.  Furthermore, an additional direction for the continuous development of doctors is the treatment of neurological diseases. A separate department for Alzheimer's and dementia pays maximum attention to rehabilitating patients for independent living. 3D movement and balance assessment with an infrared camera and DV cameras during walking allow for developing special rehabilitation programs and preventing repeated falls.

Furthermore, the latest developments in the field of pediatric ophthalmology date back to 2015. Doctors of the medical center used intra-arterial chemotherapy for eye cancer - retinoblastoma with a high success rate. Owing to the high technology and the incredible experience, remedy methods unique to Poland are still observed. Thanks to the FLUOBEAM LX, endocrine surgeons performed a unique operation to remove the thyroid gland while preserving the parathyroid glands. This approach reduces the postoperative child's risks of disturbance of calcium metabolism, which is vitally important. Cardioneuroablation and the Ross–Konno operation have become a real breakthrough in the cardiac treatment of children and require high professionalism. Over time, patients have been carefully examined, and the significant effect of the treatment has been revealed. Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaan important place in Poland's pediatric field of medicine, promoting modern treatment methods. Neurology and neurosurgery, ophthalmology and ENT, gastroenterology and endocrinology, rare genetic congenital and acquired defects, general and intensive care and emergency medical care are available to young patients at a high level."

Due to high-efficiency results for 20 years, the medical center received recognition from the European Association and ISO. The key to the success of the treatment is a detailed analysis of the problem, a comprehensive approach, and careful attention to the patient's wishes (for example, regarding the growth line and direction of hair growth).

Recognition from JCI and high-quality service evaluation by ISO have led to even more significant investments in innovative treatments. Istanbul Florence Nightingale Hospital Kadikoy achieved tremendous success in cardiac surgery. The postoperative infection and complication rate is less than 1%, the same as the best hospitals in the world.  Using the DaVinci robot and non-surgical heart valve replacement (TAVI) allows cardiac surgeons to treat inoperable, complex, high-risk patients. Videothoracoscopic surgery (VATS) complements DaVinci Robotic Thoracic Surgery and reduces the mortality rate after operations to 1% (4% less than other medical centers worldwide).  This approach is especially relevant for lung cancer and tumors spreading to the aorta. Also, the center of plastic and reconstructive surgery is delighted with the completed treatment due to techniques that leave invisible scars on the body. Furthermore, mandatory histological examination of the mammary gland during its reduction or correction does not allow doctors to miss signs of the disease and significantly reduces the risk of cancer. In addition, specialists conduct gynecological examinations and treat urinary incontinence and menopause. Even in women's health, the advanced gynecology center is trained to perform robotic surgery, which is relevant due to the reduced risk of damage to the ovaries, uterus, or blood vessels.

Particular awareness is paid to the treatment of prostate cancer and gynecological surgery. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is used to study the structure of the tumor in detail and determine its exact localization. Such a diagnosis is essential for performing a biopsy, studying the prevalence of metastases in the lymph nodes, and determining the tumor's boundaries. One of the crucial achievements is using the unique SMART (Salwa Modified Advanced Robotic Technique) prostatectomy. This method was developed within the hospital's walls and patented in Poland. The medical center surgeons were awarded the European Section of Robotic Urology (ERUS) and published in the prestigious journal European Urology Supplements for significant success in improving the robotic technique. Gynecologists also perform complex surgical interventions on women with endometriosis, even when organs such as the intestines or sacro-uterine ligaments are deeply affected. In addition, doctors have experience and a special certificate for performing surgical interventions at DaVinci's work. In particular, minimally invasive operations remove uterine fibroids, hysterectomy, or endometriosis. Furthermore, in addition to genital surgery, Medicover Сlinic Warsaw's cardiosurgical care has made significant progress. For example, special equipment CARTO 3 and En Site Precision are the latest navigation systems for catheter treatment of arrhythmias.

Gamma Knife Exira Center Katowice,"Gamma Knife Exira Center Katowice was opened in 2013 by the private network Voxel SA Capital Group in Poland. Innovative non-invasive cancer treatment methods allowed the hospital to gain popularity among the local population and outside the country. The clinic uses modern technologies thanks to highly experienced doctors trained in leading special centers in the USA and France. Before each treatment, the patient is individually examined to determine the most accurate therapy, particularly the Signa Voyager 1. 5 Tesla MRI. The main direction of the medical center is the treatment of brain tumors. Thanks to Lеkѕеll Gаmmа Knіfе Perfexion of the Swedish company Elekta, oncologists have the opportunity to specifically affect the tumor with an accuracy of 0. 15 mm through special collimators. Treatment of tumors is possible even in cases of the deep location of the impression. Due to the absence of incisions, the need for general anesthesia disappears. Local anesthesia in the places where the frame is attached is performed by qualified anesthesiologists who accompany the person during the entire treatment. The course of treatment consists of 1 procedure and has minimal complications thanks to the robotic system. The device's work concentrates on the place of impression and the scattered rays upon entering the human body. This approach makes it possible to obtain a minimal impression of the surrounding tissues and to concentrate the high intensity of the impression precisely in malignant tumors. A clear separation of healthy and affected tissues allows for preserving functions, which is especially important for the brain.

Many years of experience with an impeccable reputation are the institution's strengths. The most significant development of Torun Matopat Hospital was in neurosurgery and ophthalmology. For example, much attention is paid to the rapid resolution of chronic pain issues. Balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty allow the affected discs and vertebrae to be filled with special high-quality cement under local anesthesia. Also, the method helps to have a simultaneous effect on nerve endings and a pain prescription. Thanks to one puncture, the patient receives the elimination of the cause of pain and relief of symptoms. Endoscopic microdiscectomy, laser decompression, DISCOGEL, and RF thermal therapy are minimally invasive spine surgery. A small number of incisions and complications allows for a quick recovery of the patient, which is the primary goal of remedy.  Indirect spinal canal decompression and intervertebral foramen using D-Trax intra-articular implants allow various innovative treatment approaches for patients with radicular syndromes in the cervical shoulder or shoulder. Only 2 tiny incisions and restoration of motor functions during the day are especially attractive to patients.  Finally, it is impossible not to mention that the hospital was the first to perform innovative inguinal hernia surgery using a special OPTOMESH 3D mesh.  The intervention's success and popularity improved the service thanks to the updated OPTOMESH 3D ILAM. The product is individual for each patient and is created thanks to data based on CT with perfect adaptation to the anatomical structures of the groin. Innovation and modernity are also followed in ophthalmic treatment thanks to Alcon and Zeiss devices. Laser correction (PRK, LASIK, and SMILE) has a high and long-lasting effect with 100% vision restoration without long rehabilitation. Torun Matopat Medical Center is a center of modern technologies and treatment according to the world gold standards. As a result, the patient can treat most diseases under one roof, including cardiac, gastroenterological, neurological, and orthopedic. In addition, the high level of surgical services allows optimal treatment with minimal trauma."

Since the cuts are made on the inside or in the hair area, no visible scar remains after the healing process.  In addition, piezoelectric and ultrasonic rhinoplasty is quite popular, which allows avoiding significant traumatization of the nasal structures and reducing the recovery period.

In addition, constantly updating knowledge and implementing robotic training methods improve conditions even in complex cases."
VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Ostseebad Damp,"VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Ostseebad Damp started its work in 1973 under the leadership of the best German sports doctor, prof. Hannes Schoberth. Now, it is currently the second-largest rehabilitation hospital in Germany. 11,000 patients annually receive impeccable quality care and leave positive feedback. In addition, the magazines Stern and Focus recognized the rehabilitation center as one of the best in Germany.  Also, the AOK Health Navigator and the Association of Private Clinics (VPKSH) confirm the quality of treatment.

VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Geesthacht,"VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Geesthacht is a rehabilitation center with a rich history. Doctors work with patients up to 25 years old with neurological and orthopedic diseases. The hospital provides outpatient and inpatient services to more than 100 patients. As early as 1912, a sanatorium for women was established in the Geesthacht VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic. Later, it was used as a refugee hospital under British and German administrations and the military. Since 1985, the territory has been reorganizing and expanding to rehabilitate children with brain injuries. With time, the center has acquired its current functionality and appearance, with 175 seats. Nowadays, more than 200 highly qualified employees provide uninterrupted work. The clinic operates according to high standards according to DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 and has the ""Sign of confirmed quality of medical rehabilitation"".  Applying evidence-based methods with high efficiency in complex treatment provides opportunities to treat patients of the youngest age. The neuropediatric field is trendy, especially for children with general developmental disorders, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and after injuries. Encephalitis, surgeries, brain hemorrhages, cancers, and spina bifida are also considered for treatment. Inhibition and stiffness of movements and spasticity are well treated with the help of physical therapy methods (Bobat).  The Armeo®Spring robot simulator develops the hand even with minor movements.  The SAEBO orthosis reduces seizures in the fingers and allows the child to learn to grasp objects. Therapeutic swimming, training in a wheelchair, and classes in the gym under an exceptional program help to restore movements and increase their accuracy and strength. Impaired swallowing and pronunciation are also frequent problems of neurological patients, so parallel speech therapy is quite popular. Rehabilitators consider the patient's age and use game methods of neuropedagogy for children.  For more complex patients with Undine syndrome, muscular dystrophy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or severe cerebral palsy, artificial lung ventilation and weaning are available, as well as intensive care.  Therapeutic bronchoscopy, respiratory therapy, and cough support are also used as needed. After improving the condition, the patient can start a regular diet with the support of highly experienced doctors after long-term tube or parenteral nutrition. The clinic reflected many years of experience in treatment methods and an in-depth approach to patients. The pediatric direction in neurological diseases and orthopedics has long been no challenge for the doctors of the VAMED Rehabilitation Center in Geesthacht. Also, they greatly succeed in rehabilitating even complex cases."
VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Schloss Schonhagen,"VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Schloss Schonhagen has been a private center since 1993.

Today, the rehabilitation center specializes in cancer patients and has 260 beds. The services are used by 3,500 patients annually, making the clinic one of the best in Germany, according to Focus magazine. The surrounding nature of the Baltic resort of Schönhagen, next to the sandy beach, is a gorgeous complement. Sandy beaches are available for patients to visit outside of hospital hours. However, 120 employees worry about the uninterrupted provision of high-quality modern treatment. Sports activities have been proven to reduce cancer risk or its return. This goal is critical for the center's rehabilitators, so physical therapy, nordic walking, stretching, swimming, and gymnastics are used depending on the patient's needs. At the same time, doctors reduce pain, swelling, and tension in the body and positively affect the psychological state.  Pelvic floor training, additional testing, sexual activity counseling, and supportive care materials can help manage urinary incontinence. Due to complex treatment, patients often lose the ability to work and perform specific movements. A unique set of exercises has been developed for breast and bowel cancer rehabilitation. Occupational therapy promotes the regeneration of nerves in the affected areas by stimulating and innervating nerve endings. It also helps patients to distract themselves and feel confident in their abilities.  Thanks to the modern computer technologies ""Cogpack and Fresh Minder"", cognitive skills for memorization and attention are also generated.  Separate lectures on stomas are available for patients who need them for greater confidence in the care and to find the benefits of this lifestyle. Doctors offer a new look at the problem and remove the burden of shame from the patients.  Chemotherapy can also be done in a rehabilitation center in a relaxed atmosphere with all the options of rehabilitation and leisure.

Yeditepe University Kozyatagi Hospital Istanbul,"Yeditepe University Kozyatagi Hospital Istanbul is one of the city's first private medical faculties and teaching hospitals, opened in 2005 under the auspices of the Istanbul Education and Culture Foundation and Yeditepe University. The university is a research center that has led to a wide range of innovative biomedical research firmly embedded in assessing patient needs. The medical center serves 190 beds and 30,000 patients. The hospital, equipped with entirely non-flammable, non-scratch, and anti-bacterial materials, has carefully considered every detail necessary for human health. The high technology of the clinic is impressive: one of the most technological devices in the world is a Multislice CT (multislice computer tomography) 3 Tesla MR, PET-CT (identification of cancer cells), and a gamma camera. These devices facilitate diagnosis and treatment and have their place in the screening center of the hospital. The multidisciplinary Yeditepe Istanbul University Kozyatagi Clinic emphasizes scientific experience and quickly translates it into the practical treatment of patients.  Minimally invasive treatment methods in surgery with the fastest recovery are a great advantage.

APEX Clinic Istanbul,"APEX Clinic Istanbul is a highly specialized private medical center providing plastic surgery, hair transplants, and dental services since 2007. The clinic is the leading cosmetic surgery center in Turkey. A vital advantage of the medical center is close cooperation with MYA hospitals and a comprehensive approach to solving several problems simultaneously. In its arsenal, the institution has only certified doctors with extensive experience in modern treatment with a high level of success. The high technology of operating rooms and strict adherence to infection control rules ensure quick procedures and do not require an extended patient stay in the hospital. Surgical intervention, which is performed with the help of technological devices of the new generation, allows treatment without complications. The comprehensive ""Maternity Makeover"" program combines several aesthetic operations that correct the natural deformations of the abdomen, thighs, and breasts after childbirth and breastfeeding. In addition, simultaneous vaginal aesthetics is possible if necessary. Another similar program is ""Sixpack surgery"" for men and ""Twopack surgery"" for women who want an athletic and muscular body structure. General anesthesia is used during the process, and minor surgical incisions 4-5 mm long are hidden under the natural skin folds. With liposuction and redistribution of fatty tissue, doctors can relieve and ton the body in a few hours. Another area of interest for surgeons is bariatric surgery: Roux-En-Y and Mini-Gastric Bypass (installation of only one shunt), Gastric Sleeve Surgery, and Diabetic Bypass. Doctors aim to perform the most minimally invasive operations using laparoscopy, which requires smaller incisions and shortens the rehabilitation. Diabetic bypass reduces weight, increases insulin production, and treats diabetes by creating a compound in the intestine that stimulates the pancreas. Also, the hospital uses gastric botox because of endoscopic administration and the absence of incisions. Another general service is hair transplantation (FUT, FUE, DHI, Manual Punch, and robotic and hyperbaric hair transplantation). Robotic transplantation allows the best result in follicle density and engraftment due to greater accuracy of execution. APEX Clinic Istanbul offers plastic correction of the face (ears, nose, eyelids, incision of the eyes, cheeks, and skin tightening) and body (chest, abdomen, arms and legs, buttocks, genitals). In addition, bariatric surgery and dental treatment are highly successful and popular among clients. Hair transplants are available to men and women and can be used on various body parts (including the head and beard). Patient orientation and working on achieving the best result in the shortest time is the central concept of the medical institution and specialists."
Florence Nightingale Hospital Gayrettepe Istanbul,"Florence Nightingale Hospital Gayrettepe Istanbul is a private general hospital with a world-renowned advanced oncology center. Patient orientation, easy availability of high-tech diagnostics, and innovative treatment under one roof allowed the clinic to receive a JCI gold certificate and a high ISO rating. 87 beds, 10 intensive care beds for adults, 20 intensive care beds for newborns, and 6 operating rooms ensure the function of the medical center. In addition, each department is equipped with the latest in modern medicine. The oncology center provides various remedy services, covering early diagnosis and therapy of highly complex, inoperable cases. In the latter case, the GammaKnife is quite relevant and allows affecting the entire thickness of the oncological lesion without incisions and harm to the body. Immunotherapy and stem cell therapy, True Beam, Rapid Arc, IMRT, PET-MRI, and second-generation sequencing devices significantly increase the chance of recovery and complement the primary therapy.  A detailed study of the genetic makeup of a tumor allows oncologists to individually evaluate the possibilities of the newest medical cure, which explicitly affects the mechanism of the formation of cancer tumors.  Certificates from the United Kingdom's National External Quality Assessment Service and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich guarantee that Florence Nightingale Hospital Gayrettepe in Istanbul is recommended for remedy with a high rate of oncology recovery. Also, intraoperative radiology is another area of the medical center's continuous development. Treatment of hemangiomas and vascular malformations (AVMs) without incisions is possible with the help of angiography by the embolization method. In addition, uterine fibroids are treated with embolization, radiofrequency ablation, and HIFU ablation. The same methods are available for the non-surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, obesity, and thyroid gland and are not limited to this list. This approach allows patients not to spend time on an extended stay in the hospital and, therefore, to agree to treatment faster and not postpone it. Also, modern approaches are observed in ophthalmic treatment thanks to EXCIMER LASER and intraocular lenses. Hospital Florence Nightingale Gayrettepe Istanbul is a center of minimally invasive and gentle treatment with the most modern methods. Thanks to the concept of treatment with minor intervention, the clinic has gained popularity in oncological and surgical treatment, as well as in treating gynecological, cardiovascular, urological, and children's diseases."
VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Bad Ems,"VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Bad Ems is a private specialized orthopedic rehabilitation clinic located since 2010 in one of the most picturesque areas of the Lahn Valley. Bad Ems is on the UNESCO list and has received the highest international award for cultural sites. In addition, the rehabilitation center acquired the VPKSH quality mark and is a member of the premium class of the national portal Qualitatskliniken. The rehabilitation center serves patients after implantation of endoprostheses, fractures of limbs, bones of the pelvis, and spine and spine surgery, as well as degenerative diseases of peripheral joints and disc diseases and inflammatory and metabolic diseases of the musculoskeletal system. Treatment takes place in a specially equipped building with ramps, elevators, and comfortable wards with 145 beds. Doctors provide remedies through basic physiotherapy techniques and combine various approaches. Manual therapy, lymphatic drainage, massages, heat application, and cryotherapy improve local circulation and reduce inflammation. Electrotherapy and ultrasound activate metabolic processes in the body, eliminate acute pain, and normalize muscle tone. Impulse currents expand blood vessels and provide a neurostimulation effect.  For fractures, orthopedists have extensive experience in extension treatment by gradually pulling out the affected area for better fracture alignment and restoration of joint movement.  Bobat therapy is also used to achieve three goals: inhibiting unnatural postures and movements, strengthening regular (correct) movements, and using tactile and kinesthetic stimuli, thanks to which the patient perceives and learns correct movements.  In addition, the clinic has a wide selection of exercise equipment, such as MOTOMED and cycle ergometers for the upper body and a treadmill.  Trainers provide an individual approach and correct performance of repetitive exercises. Group arthroplasty classes, orthopedic back school, and arthroplasty groups allow for the exchange of experience between patients and contribute to greater motivation, diversifying therapy. In addition to classic rehabilitation, doctors provide nutrition counseling services, namely whole nutrition, food intolerance (lactose intolerance, allergy, gluten enteropathy), and special diets related to diseases (dialysis, chronic renal failure, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, diabetes, obesity, heart disease). Furthermore, the psychological direction is aimed at relaxation exercises (autogenic training, progressive muscle relaxation) and lectures on the psychological aspects of pain, stress management, and smoking cessation."
VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Hagen-Ambrock,"VAMED Rehabilitation Clinic Hagen-Ambrock is in the middle of a fantastic forest with its park and pond. Beautiful nature and coniferous air contribute to a pleasant rest and exercise outside. Also, it diversifies the stay with numerous excursions and activities. The rehabilitation clinic serves 2,000 patients on an inpatient and outpatient basis. The general rehabilitation and intensive care units accommodate 194 beds provided by 700 employees. A long time ago, in 1903, the clinic building was opened as a lung sanatorium. The constant development and expansion of services allowed the center to become a pioneer in treating sleep apnea with the largest sleep laboratory in Europe. Cooperation with the Ruhr University of Bochum and the University of Witten/Herdecke guaranteed the institution's further prosperity. Hagen-Ambrock VAMED Rehabilitation Center currently has one of the largest intensive care units for neurology and pneumology in Germany. In 2006, the medical center was recognized by the German Multiple Sclerosis Society. Although the disease cannot be cured, doctors influence the progression and psychological support at the highest level. The multidisciplinary treatment includes physical and sports therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy (including FEES endoscopic swallowing study), neuropsychology, social and nutritional counseling, and art/music therapy. Such methods improve movements, reduce pain, and return to self-care. Special functional tests for walking and fine motor skills (9-hole peg test), the PASAT test, and a detailed neuropsychological test allow an even more careful selection of individual remedies.  In addition to standard rehabilitation, the intensive care unit offers care for patients with severe brain damage or mechanical ventilation.  Doctors provide patient management training and assistive devices such as a baclofen pump or myoelectric splints for severe aches. The TENS method also reduces pain intensity by stimulating nerve cells.  Considering the profile of the hospital, it is also possible to carry out the rehabilitation of sexual disorders medically and conservatively.  Pulmonary diseases are another critical area of the clinic. Pulmonologists and rehabilitators help the patient restore independent breathing, overcome the complications of allergic conditions, such as bronchial asthma, and increase breathing volume. Additional functional diagnostics and CT allow for finding additional causes of the disorder and monitoring progress.  Thanks to cooperation with the hospitals of the HELIOS network, it is possible to quickly organize surgical intervention and cure in case of lung cancer detection. Doctors offer rehabilitation in the neurourological, neurosurgical, and neurological departments, as well as in the pulmonary dispensary and intensive care. A functional laboratory (electrophysiology, ultrasound), radiology department, specialists from other disciplines (psychiatry and psychotherapy, general medicine and diabetology, pain therapy, sleep medicine), and consulting doctors are also available. In addition, speech and music therapy change the ability to speak (voice strength, articulation, breathing)."
